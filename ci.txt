formula = p(1 + i)*n

1 + x = 10.12

x = 10.12 - 1

problems :

a = p(1+r/n)*nt


compound interest lessons :

p = original amount
r = interest rate
n = number of times it is compounded a year

e.g weekly n = 52
    monthly = 12
    yearly = 365

 t = maximum years it is compounded


 equation 2 : (if compounded continuously )
a = pe*rt

p = original amount
e = euler's number
r = rate
y = years
